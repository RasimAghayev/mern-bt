# The image carries the source, so the container needs no bind mount of the
# repository. Every bind mount of the compose stack lives under var/ (R92).
#
# The base image is pinned by digest: the lock file is resolved against
# Node.js 22, and a floating tag would let the runtime drift away from the
# platform the lock file was built for.
