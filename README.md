# mern-bt

A personal follow-along of Brad Traversy's **"MERN Stack Front To Back"**
course — building a social-network REST API (Node/Express/MongoDB) with a
React/Redux client. The repository's own `package.json` description names
the course directly; this README documents what the **default branch
(`master`)** actually contains, since that's what a visitor sees first.

## What's actually on `master`

`master` is **backend-only** — there is no `client/`, `fe/`, or any React
code on this branch, despite the course (and the repo description) being
about a full MERN app with a React/Redux frontend.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server.js` | Express app entry point; loads the environment, checks the configuration, mounts four API routers, connects to MongoDB on boot. |
| `config/db.js` | Mongoose connection. |
| `config/default.json` | Declares the configuration keys. Holds no credential. |
| `config/custom-environment-variables.json` | Maps `mongoURI` to `MONGODB_URI` and `jwtSecretKey` to `JWT_SECRET`. |
| `config/secrets.js` | Reads the two secrets, refuses to start a production run without them, and redacts connection strings before they are logged. |
| `middleware/auth.js` | Verifies a JWT passed in the `x-api-token` header. |
| `models/User.js`, `models/Profile.js` | Mongoose schemas — `User` (name/email/password/avatar) and `Profile` (company/skills/experience/education/social links). |
| `routers/api/users.js` | `POST /api/users` — register a user (bcrypt-hashed password, Gravatar avatar, returns a JWT). |
| `routers/api/auth.js` | `GET /api/auth` (current user, JWT-protected), `POST /api/auth` (login, returns a JWT). |
| `routers/api/profile.js` | Profile CRUD for the current user, plus experience/education sub-resources (`PUT`/`DELETE`) and public profile lookups. |
| `routers/api/posts.js` | **Stub only** — `GET /` returns the literal string `"Posts route."`. No create/list/delete, and there is no `models/Post.js` on this branch. |
| `test/` | The test suite, run by the built-in Node test runner. |
| `command.txt` | Scratch notes of the `npm install`/`npm audit` commands run while building the project — not a script. |

## Setup

Node.js 18 or newer and a MongoDB server are required.

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in MONGODB_URI and JWT_SECRET
npm run server           # nodemon, http://localhost:5000
```

`npm start` runs the same server without the file watcher.

### Configuration

| Variable | Read at | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | `config/secrets.js:38` | MongoDB connection string. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `config/secrets.js:64` | Secret used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens. |
| `PORT` | `server.js:33` | Port the HTTP server listens on. Defaults to `5000`. |
| `NODE_ENV` | `config/secrets.js:30` | Set to `production` to make the server require the two values above. |

The values are read from the environment, which the `config` package maps
onto the configuration keys through `config/custom-environment-variables.json`.
A `.env` file in the project root is loaded at start-up. The same values can
be placed in `config/local.json` or `config/production.json` instead — all
three locations are ignored by git, and the environment wins over the files.

**Never commit a credential.** `config/default.json` deliberately holds no
connection string and no signing secret, `.env` and the `config/local.json`
and `config/production.json` overrides are ignored, and `.env.example`
carries placeholders only. A test in `test/no-committed-credentials.test.js`
fails the build if a committed file carries a connection string with a user
name and a password.

When `NODE_ENV=production` the server refuses to start if `MONGODB_URI` or
`JWT_SECRET` is missing or still holds a placeholder value; it exits with a
message naming the variable. In development both fall back to safe values:
a local MongoDB without a user name, and a random secret that is regenerated
on every restart.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

The suite runs on the Node test runner and covers the token verification
rules, the protection of the mutating profile routes, the bounded profile
listing, the configuration rules described above, and a scan of the committed
files for credentials. It needs no database and no network access.

The `install and test` workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same
command on every push and pull request.

## Branches: the React/Redux frontend exists, but not here

`master` follows the course's dependency-bump line: the course work on it
ends at `081c4b0` and only holds Renovate dependency bumps after that. The
course itself continued on branches that were never merged forward, so
`master` is not the most advanced state of the project.

- **`Section-5`** adds `models/Post.js` and real create/list/comment/like
  routes to `routers/api/posts.js` (vs. `master`'s stub).
- **`Section-6` through `Section-9`** add `fe/`, a full Create React App
  frontend with `react-redux`, `redux`, `redux-thunk`, and
  `react-router-dom` — matching the course's "React, Redux" description —
  plus a static `devconnector_html_theme/` reference theme. `Section-9` is
  the most advanced state found.

The published branches `Section-5` to `Section-9` share history with
`master` up to `059cc15` ("22. Add & Delete Profile Education"); none of
them is merged into `master` (confirmed with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`).
A visitor to the repo's default branch sees a backend-only stub of the
project the description advertises.

## Known limitations

- **The `posts` feature does not exist on `master`** — see "Branches"
  above; it is a stub pending a merge that never happened.
- **No `client`/`fe` React app on `master`** despite the repo/course
  description — see "Branches."
- **No `LICENSE` file.**
- **Credentials that were committed in the past are still in the git
  history.** An earlier version of this repository kept a MongoDB
  connection string with an embedded user name and password, a JSON Web
  Token signing secret, and a GitHub OAuth client id and secret in
  `config/default.json`. The values were removed from the working tree, but
  they remain readable in the older commits and in the published
  `Section-5` to `Section-9` branches. Treat them as compromised: rotate
  the database password, the token signing secret, and the GitHub OAuth
  client secret, and use the environment variables described above from now
  on. Removing the old values from the history needs a history rewrite and
  a force push, which is a decision for the repository owner.

## Security notes

- Tokens are signed and verified with `HS256` only; a token that asks for a
  different algorithm is rejected.
- Every mutating profile route requires a valid token, including the
  deletion of the account.
- A password is never part of a response: the current-user route selects
  every field except `password`, and the populated user documents are
  limited to `name` and `avatar`.
- The profile listing is bounded to 100 entries per request and accepts
  `?page=` and `?limit=`.
- A connection string is redacted before a database error is written to the
  log.
